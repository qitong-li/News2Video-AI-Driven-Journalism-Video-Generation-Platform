# This Architect Could’ve Lived ‘High Above the Clouds.’ Instead He Chose Community.

## Eran Chen brings us inside his New York loft, which he divided into four distinct zones—including a leafy indoor garden

When the architect Eran Chen and his wife, Dafna Chen, a scientist and graduate student in Greek and Roman history, paid $6 million for a loft in Tribeca in 2020, they could have moved right in. The 5,100-square-foot apartment, with four bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths, stretched a whole block south from busy Canal Street to quaint Lispenard Street, with rows of large windows at either end.

Instead, Eran, 53, spent two years and about $3 million turning the loft into a home that felt right for him and Dafna, 47, and their three children, now 15, 16 and 17. That meant making it both more comfortable to live in and more compelling to look at. Photos provided by the realtors in 2020 show a large, flexible space—but one in which modestly scaled tables and chairs form five separate furniture groupings in the living room alone. The effect is pleasant, but also somewhat chaotic, without any discernible spatial organization.

Now the loft is divided into four zones, with floor-to-ceiling, steel-framed doors and windows marking transitions from public to private spaces. ”We love to have people over, so my highest priority was creating a layout that separated entertainment spaces from our bedrooms,” Dafna says.

The most public zone, right off the elevator, consists of a south-facing living room, dining room and open kitchen, which together total almost 2,000 square feet. The kitchen island alone is as big as some apartment kitchens. The island, Dafna says, “is where we all gather to cook, eat, talk, work and study every day. Our previous apartment was much smaller, so for years we did those things in a very compact space. Even in the new loft, the children choose to spend time gathered around the island rather than alone in their bedrooms.”

The front room’s other anchor is a 25-foot-long, back-to-back sofa, part of the Extra Soft series designed by Piero Lissoni for Living Divani. It is big enough to define two separate seating areas: In one direction, there is room for the children and a dozen of their friends to watch TV. In the other direction, guests can watch the show at the Lacanche range as Dafna or Eran prepares dinner for the family. Most meals are served at a table made from a 20-foot-long slab of reclaimed wood that Eran says was found at the bottom of the Panama Canal. Surrounding the table are 10 chairs by the great Pennsylvania woodworker George Nakashima. Above it is a light fixture that the Spanish designer Nacho Carbonell made by spraying pigmented concrete onto steel mesh. That puts it in a category—industrial materials made to look organic—that fascinates Eran. Indeed, it has an analogue in the credenza by the Campana Brothers—Humberto and the late Fernando—made largely of found materials. Throughout the space, exposed ceiling joists and columns, bare brick walls and steel accents recall the building’s industrial past.



Glass doors from the foyer lead to the living/dining room. The kitchen island includes work surfaces and a “lower deck” for family meals.

From that section of the apartment, doors open onto a zone of slightly less public spaces: a gallery, home office, family room, and guest suite. The central parts of the apartment don’t have windows, but Eran installed a system, made by Ketra, that syncs interior lights to the color and intensity of the sun as it moves across the sky, mimicking outdoor conditions indoors

The next zone contains the couple’s bedroom, three children’s bedrooms and three bathrooms that use the gridded glass-and-metal partitions as shower enclosures. That is not the last time the grids appear. All four bedrooms have glass walls that open onto a 300-square-foot indoor garden overlooking Canal Street. The black-tiled space is filled with plants and acts as an urban green zone for the family.



Built-ins, including steel-framed cabinetry, were fabricated on-site. The loft was big enough to accommodate carpenters and metal workers.

It isn’t quite a terrace, but it’s the next best thing, given that the bustle of Canal Street would make a real terrace impractical. And it is redolent of meaning for Eran, who as a boy lived with his mother in a government housing project in the southern Israeli city of Beersheva. The project consisted of three six-story buildings in a U-shape. Each apartment had a terrace facing into the U, which made the courtyard a kind of community playground and social hall, turning a place people lived into a place they loved.

Eran remembers that courtyard whenever he designs a residential building; his goal is to foster social interaction. Denizen, a 1,000,000-square foot, 911-unit luxury rental building in Bushwick, Brooklyn, has every amenity you would expect (pool, gym, lounges) and many you wouldn’t: a baby grand piano in one section of the sprawling lobby, a bowling alley in another; maker spaces and outdoor ping-pong tables; and, on the roof, a functioning hydroponic farm next to a miniature golf course. One bedrooms start at $3,300 a month.



All four bedrooms have glass walls that open onto an indoor garden. The black-tiled space is filled with plants and acts as an urban green zone for the family.

But as nearly every architect or planner will concede, it’s hard to provide communal spaces for the wealthy, who tend to live in gated communities or doorman buildings and aren’t likely to be seen chatting on stoops. Eran isn’t exactly living his life in public, but he says that buying a second floor apartment was a deliberate choice. “For the price we paid we could have been high above the clouds,” he says, adding, “Twenty years ago luxury meant isolation. Today more people want community.” To achieve that, he says, “We should wisely use things that are free and fun,” he says. “Light and air are free; visual connections are free.”Eran knows the other residents of the six unit Tribeca building, as well as their dogs. (His is a chocolate lab named Boo.) “We feel part of the neighborhood fabric,” he says.

Becoming part of that neighborhood took a lot of work. The loft fills an entire floor of an L-shaped 1883 building and a smaller building that “fills in” the empty corner of the L. Connecting them at the second floor level meant removing parts of what had been their exterior walls. Before the contractors could do that, Eran says, they had to insert steel beams to support the four floors above his.



The couple’s bathroom is divided into compartments by steel-framed walls and doors of transparent and translucent glass.

That was expensive, as were the steel-framed interior doors and windows. The loft is so big, Eran says, that he was able to bring in metalworkers to make the window frames on site. That allowed them to adjust to tiny imperfections in the 140-year-old building. “Everything was custom-made in the space for the space,” says Eran, who often walked over from his firm’s office at 99 Hudson Street to monitor construction. Meanwhile, the Chens lived in an Upper West Side apartment and their weekend house in Waccabuc, New York. 

Dafna was less directly involved in the project than her husband. “I would design every item and show her the choices,” Eran says. “There were only a few disagreements and naturally she prevailed.” As an example, he says “I was pressing for natural stone in our bathroom. She wanted tile. We ended up using tile, and she was right.”

Eran has come a long way from the public housing of his childhood. He studied architecture at the Bezalel Academy of Art in Jerusalem. After graduating in 1999 he came to New York, he says, with “just a suitcase.” He took a job at Perkins Eastman, a global architecture firm. Coming from a small town in a small country, he says, he made a deliberate choice to learn about the workings of a large-scale practice. After seven years, he went out on his own, calling his firm ODA (for Office of Design and Architecture), perhaps in homage to Rem Koolhaas’s Rotterdam-based OMA (Office for Metropolitan Architecture).

He landed his first client by offering to do the job for half the standard fee. Soon the firm was designing building after building in New York, including the renovated 10 Jay Street in Dumbo. There ODA restored the masonry on three sides of an old brick warehouse building but turned the fourth side, facing the East River, into a crystalline glass surface.

Other buildings in New York include the 100 Norfolk condo on the Lower East Side and Galerie condo in Long Island City. ODA buildings often take novel forms, many resembling stacks of blocks with extreme setbacks and cantilevers.



Denizen, a massive apartment building in Bushwick, Brooklyn, features an unusual range of amenities for its mostly youngish tenants. At 10 Jay Street, a commercial building, also in Brooklyn, ODA restored three vintage brick facades but replaced the fourth facade with a wall of crystalline glass.FROM LEFT: MIGUEL DE GUZMAN; PAVEL BENDOV

The firm, with about 100 employees, has been expanding both nationally (with, for example, large mixed-use projects in Charlotte, N.C., and Washington, D.C.) and internationally, with projects in Europe, South America and Asia. In a book about the practice, “ODA: Office of Design and Architecture” (Rizzoli), out this month, the architecture critic Paul Goldberger writes: “ODA’s work shows formal inventiveness, a willingness to solve problems, and most important of all, a recognition that no building is purely an object in itself, but a part of a larger urban whole.”

Lately, Eran has been exploring the larger urban whole of Tel Aviv, where he is building apartment towers that put his ideas to the test. He says, “if people would feel better connected to their community you create a better culture and then a better world.”
